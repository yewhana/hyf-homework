        <P>
          Example of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce 
          led by web development include e-commerce. online auction sites such  as 
          eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. online
          retailers such as Amazon.com and buy.com(among many others) have transformed the shopping
          and bargain-huntingn experience for many consumers.

        <h2>
          PRACTICAL web DEVELOPMENT
        </h2>
        <P>
          Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry.
          The growing of this industry is being driven by businessses to use their webite to sell
          products and services to customers.[1]
        </P>
        <p>
          There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB,GlassFish, LAMP(Linux,Apache
          , MYSQL ,PHP) stack and pert/plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development
          to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of
          easy t-to-use WYSIWYG web -development software, such as Adobe DreanWeaver,BlueGriffon and 
          Microsoft Visual Studio.Knoledge of HyperText Markup laguage is still requiered to use 
          such software but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help 
          files, technical books, internet tutorials, O face- to-face training.
        </p>
        <p>
          An ever- growing set of tools and techologies have helped developers build more dynamic
          and interactive websites, further, web developers 
          now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only
          available as application on a desk-based computer.
          This has allowed bor many opportunities to do centralize information and media distibution.
          Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox
          and Google Docs. These web sevices allow users to interact with applications from many
          locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.
